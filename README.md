This is a project I created as per specifications in C&G Procedural programming module during the course of my FIT ICTAP Software Development apprenticeship.  
In the case of this assignment, it consists of two projects.  The goal of this assignment is to reuse the intial website developed, and create additional features that allow for users to create bookings which can be assigned to tour guides, allow for tour guides to be able to run these tours based on their commission and generate a payroll. 

This website is hosted at: http://iram.innovador-ie.com/index.html

1) Howth Website - This website was initially developed as part of the Web Development module using HTML, CSS
2) Global Tour Operators - The Howth website was reused as part of this specification, with the addition of PHP and adding additional features, such as:
3)   ✧ 'Bookings' feature added to website  http://iram.innovador-ie.com/bookings.php 
5)   ✧ Allowing for users on the website to book a tour (Includes booking information, Tour selection and comments). When a booking has been made, the user is prompted with a booking reference for the booking made. 
6)   ✧ Backend Portal - Global Tour Operators for Staff/Tour operators to use (Staff Login button on Bookings page redirects you to portal) 
7)  ✧ Global Tour Operators Staff Login Page http://iram.innovador-ie.com/admin/index.php (Please see *Testing* for credentials)
8)   FAQ's button - available on each page in the Global Tour Operators portal
